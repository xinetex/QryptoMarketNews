1. Executive Summary
ProphetCoin.TV is a Roku-first streaming network and social distribution engine built for the prediction market era. The network is anchored by an original character brand ("The Prophet") and is paired with Prophet Markets: a web/mobile product that lets viewers participate in predictions, build reputation, and (in later phases) access compliant real-money trading through partners.
Core thesis:
Prediction markets are becoming mainstream content. Viewers want probabilities, not just opinions.
Media is the best acquisition channel; social prediction mechanics are the best retention channel.
Rather than bootstrapping an exchange, Prophet aggregates market data and distribution, then integrates compliant execution rails where permitted.
What we monetize:
Advertising and sponsorships on ProphetCoin.TV (Roku + web) and across short-form clips.
Subscriptions (premium content, alerts, and a "Prophet Terminal" analytics layer).
Trading-linked revenue in phased steps: referral/revenue-share with regulated partners first; direct transaction fees only if/when operating licensed rails.
B2B widgets and syndicated tickers (prediction odds overlays) for publishers/creators.
Merchandise and IP licensing around The Prophet character brand.
2. Vision and Product
2.1 ProphetCoin.TV (Roku-first network)
A connected-TV channel that looks like financial news, but runs on live probability signals. Every segment is paired with a live "odds ticker" and a second-screen call-to-action (QR code) that drops viewers into the relevant market/prediction in Prophet Markets.
Programming blocks (illustrative):
The Opening Prophecy: top markets moving now + "why odds moved" explainers.
Catalyst Calendar: upcoming events that should move probabilities.
The Prophet vs The Crowd: host take vs market consensus, tracked publicly.
The Scoreboard: weekly review of what the community got right/wrong (trust flywheel).
2.2 Prophet Markets (social prediction + reputation)
Prophet Markets is the retention and identity layer. Users make predictions, build a public track record, and share "position cards" to social.
MVP features:
Free-to-play predictions (points/credits) with leaderboards, streaks, and category ranks.
Watchlists and alerts when probability shifts materially.
Profiles with an accuracy score and transparency ledger (timestamped calls).
Creator rooms and tournaments (weekly leagues by topic).
2.3 The Prophet character (brand and safety)
The Prophet is a fictional character designed to be memetic and repeatable across platforms while remaining brand-safe for advertisers. The defining product principle is accountability: every on-air "prophecy" is logged against the live market probability at the time it was made.
Brand guardrails (non-negotiable):
No harassment-driven content, no incitement, no doxxing, no market prompts tied to self-harm or violence.
Clear disclaimers: entertainment/information, not financial advice.
An editorial listing policy that rejects harmful, exploitative, or illegal topics.
3. Market Opportunity
Prediction markets are expanding across categories (politics, macro, crypto, sports, entertainment). The interface is still trader-first, and mainstream audiences encounter probabilities mostly through secondary commentary. Prophet is positioned to become the primary distribution surface for market-implied probabilities: a "probability news network."
Why Roku + social is a wedge:
Roku provides a large, lean-back audience with high ad monetization potential and low friction distribution.
Social short-form (especially X) is the fastest way to build the Prophet character and pull users into the app.
Second-screen participation turns passive viewers into daily active users.
4. Technology and Data Infrastructure
Prophet is built around an aggregation-first architecture. The critical infrastructure decision is to use third-party market data/rails to avoid rebuilding liquidity and matching engines early.
4.1 Data layer (Dome API)
Dome API provides unified access to multiple prediction markets (e.g., Polymarket, Kalshi) with real-time feeds, historical pricing, and cross-market matching. This powers:
On-screen tickers and probability overlays in ProphetCoin.TV.
App dashboards (alerts, momentum, volatility, cross-venue comparison).
Automated content triggers: "odds moved" alerts when thresholds are hit.
4.2 Content production stack
A template-based graphics system generates lower-thirds and tickers from the data feed. Clips are produced with a "market tag" so each video maps to a specific question/market in the app.
5. Business Model
5.1 Advertising and sponsorships
ProphetCoin.TV monetizes through programmatic and direct-sold sponsorship inventory. Sponsorship packages are designed around recurring segments ("Odds Moved presented by...", category takeovers, and weekly scoreboard sponsorships).
5.2 Subscriptions (Prophet Pro)
Paid tier offering premium shows, ad-light viewing, deeper analytics, and real-time probability movement alerts. Subscription is positioned as a "consumer terminal" rather than a trading product.
5.3 Trading-linked revenue (how we make money from trades)
There are three viable monetization structures, ordered from lowest to highest regulatory complexity:
Model A - Free-to-play only (short-term):
Users predict with points/credits; no cash-out. Monetize via ads, sponsorships, and subscriptions.
Model B - Partner execution (recommended bridge):
Prophet Markets routes eligible users to regulated or otherwise compliant trading venues.
Prophet does not custody funds or operate the matching engine.
Revenue comes from referral fees, revenue share on net trading fees, and premium subscriptions.
Model C - Operate licensed rails (long-term option):
Prophet (or an affiliated licensed subsidiary) operates a venue or market-making stack and charges transaction fees.
Highest revenue potential but requires jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction licensing, KYC/AML, and robust compliance operations.
5.4 Additional revenue streams
B2B widgets: probability tickers embedded on publisher sites and in creator streams.
Merchandise and IP licensing around The Prophet character.
Data products: Prophet indices (crowd momentum, divergence, category sentiment) licensed to media and communities.
6. Entity and Licensing Strategy
Goal: launch quickly while preserving a clean, venture-fundable structure and minimizing existential regulatory risk. This section outlines a practical, phased approach to entity structure, DAO considerations, token launch strategy, and licensing posture.
6.1 Proposed structure (Flex-friendly)


6.2 Marshall Islands: where it helps and where it can hurt
Marshall Islands can be attractive for forming a DAO LLC quickly, but operating a virtual asset service business (exchange/custody/etc.) can trigger licensing obligations and restrictions. The safest use case is as a governance wrapper, not as the primary operating venue for trading.
Practical recommendations:
Use Marshall Islands (if chosen) primarily for DAO/governance structure, not for operating custody or exchange activity.
Keep the venture-fundable operating company separate and clean for investor ownership and employment contracts.
Do not assume offshore formation avoids U.S. or other jurisdiction rules if the product is marketed into those regions.
Start with partner-execution for any real-money trading and only operate rails after licensing is resolved.
6.3 Does a DAO make sense?
A DAO can make sense for community governance and token utility, but it should be introduced after the product proves retention and the community demonstrates real participation. For fundraising and operational speed, the early-stage system should be a traditional company with clear accountability.
DAO best-fit responsibilities (later-phase):
Community voting on content priorities and creator grants.
Funding bounties for integrations, research, and community tooling.
Optional governance of non-regulated product parameters (e.g., points multipliers, tournaments, community badges).
6.4 Native currency (Prophet Coin) strategy
Token design should be phased to avoid introducing unnecessary regulatory complexity before product-market fit.
Phase 1 - Prophet Points (off-chain loyalty):
Earned for engagement and accuracy; redeemable for perks (premium content, badges, access).
Non-transferable at launch; positioned as loyalty/reputation rather than an investment asset.
Phase 2 - Tokenized utility (only with counsel):
Enable creator tipping, access passes, and governance voting.
Avoid tying token value explicitly to trading fees or revenue distributions.
Avoid making the token the mandatory settlement currency for real-money event trading in early phases.
7. Compliance and Risk Management
7.1 Product boundary controls
Separate media (TV) from execution. Media is informational; trading access is gated and jurisdiction-aware.
Geo-fencing and eligibility checks for any real-money routing.
KYC/AML only handled by compliant partners unless/when Prophet operates licensed rails.
7.2 Market listing and content policy
Categories and topics are screened for harm and platform risk. Non-negotiables:
No markets that incentivize violence, self-harm, or criminal activity.
No markets targeting private individuals or enabling harassment.
Clear disclosures and moderation pathways.
8. Go-to-Market Plan
8.1 90-day launch plan
Launch ProphetCoin.TV MVP on Roku with a daily flagship show plus repeatable short segments.
Launch Prophet Markets in free-to-play mode (points) with leaderboards and share cards.
Daily short-form distribution to X and other short-form channels to build character familiarity and drive app installs.
First sponsorship package: segment sponsor + weekly scoreboard sponsor + category takeover.
8.2 12-month roadmap


8.3 Key metrics
Watch time per viewer (CTV) and repeat view rate.
App conversion rate from TV/social (QR + links).
Weekly active predictors and predictions per user.
Day-30 retention for Prophet Markets.
Subscriber conversion rate and churn (Prophet Pro).
9. Fundraise Ask and Use of Funds
A seed raise funds the content engine, the app experience, and the partner integrations needed to monetize trading without operating a venue immediately.
Illustrative raise options:
Pre-seed: $0.75M to $1.25M to ship Roku MVP + points app + first sponsors.
Seed: $2.0M to $4.0M to scale production, launch subscriptions, and integrate partner execution for eligible jurisdictions.
Use of funds (illustrative):
Content + production: studio, editors, motion graphics, booking.
Engineering + data: app build, overlays/tickers, reliability and tooling.
Growth: creator partnerships, experiments, distribution.
Compliance + legal: entity structuring, policy, partner contracts.
